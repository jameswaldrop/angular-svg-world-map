# World Map App

# 🌍 Angular SVG World Map

An interactive world map built with **Angular**, integrating a live **API** to display country-specific data.  
This project demonstrates key front-end development and API integration skills — transforming a static SVG into a dynamic, data-driven Angular component.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project was developed as part of a **Software Engineering degree at Western Governors University (WGU)**.  
It fulfills the requirements of building an interactive web application that uses:

- **Angular framework** for structured front-end development  
- **RESTful API** for real-time country data  
- **SVG graphics** for scalable and responsive visuals  
- **Event binding and routing** for modern UI behavior

Users can hover or click on any country to view information retrieved from an external API.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Angular** (v17)
- **TypeScript**
- **HTML5 / CSS3**
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **World Bank API**
- **SVG graphics**
- **Node.js & npm**
- **Git / GitHub**

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- Creating modular, maintainable Angular components  
- Connecting APIs to dynamic visual interfaces  
- DOM event binding and reactive data flow  
- Managing project structure in GitLab and GitHub  
- Translating UX requirements into working code
